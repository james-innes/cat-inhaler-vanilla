      <p>
        Like humans, cats can also suffer from asthma and the same method of
        treatment using an inhaler is applicable. However, unlike health care
        options for humans the inhalers and the accompanying adapters and masks
        for your pet may be limited in choice and not offer good value for
        money. A popular branded product as an example is the AeroKat which
        costs from £65 with similar products being retailed for as much as £100
        on other websites. Frankly, this is ridiculous to pay so much for a bit
        of plastic but the pet companies know there is not much choice so they
        can charge what they like. These spacer products often also force you to
        buy their own asthma cartridge from them by making the connector round.
        However, with some help from your vet, you can buy the exact same
        medical product your cat needs from your local pharmacy. In the UK the
        shape of all inhalers are standardised so our spacer is designed to fit
        this standard as pictured in the small diagram. The current prescription
        cost in the UK from the NHS is about £9 to pick up the inhaler. However
        to administer the inhaler for your cat you need the spacer and mask. A
        small vent is built into the spacer to allow for the cat to exhale. The
        mask comes in a small size to fit cats. If you need this for a dog you
        might be better off with a large mask which we do not currently sell.
        Some people have also found it cheaper to buy asthma inhaler spacers for
        babies but you will find that the mask is a little too big and covers
        the eyes of your cat which can be a traumatising for them and make
        administrating the tretment regularly a difficult task. We are a small
        company and can only sell this product in small batches so please
        understand that it may take up to 1 month for the product to arrive but
        we hope it to be with you sooner than this. Our contact details are not
        public but we will contact you by email after you have made your
        purchase.
